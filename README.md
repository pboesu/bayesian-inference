This package is a collection of useful classes for basic Bayesian inference. Currently, its main goal is to be a tool for learning and exploration of Bayesian probabilistic calculations.

Currently it also includes subpackages for stochastic simulation tools which are not strictly related to Bayesian inference, but are currently being developed within BIP. One such package is the BIP.SDE which contains a parallelized solver for stochastic differential equations, an implementation of the Gillespie direct algorithm.

The Subpackage Bayes also offers a tool for parameter estimation of Deterministic and Stochastic Dynamical Models. This tool is fully described in this paper:
